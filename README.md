# Applying Machine Learning For Credit Card Fraud Detection
Group: Mariko McDougall, Arathi Nair, Stefani Guevara

### Overview
According to WalletHub, as of 2020 the United States collectively holds almost $1 trillion in credit card debt. With a substantial volume of credit card transactions executed daily, online and in person, security is paramount to both card holders and the card companies themselves. As fraudulent activity results in millions of dollars worth of losses every year, fraud detection has thus become a necessity to all parties. Moreover, as this preventative measure becomes more expected of credit card companies by consumers, a high degree of accuracy increasingly does as well.

In this project, we take the data from the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection kaggle competition and use the machine learning techniques dicussed in the course to develop a model that predicts the probability of a fraudulent transaction. The training and test datasets constitute anonymized e-commerce transactions provided by Vesta Corporation. We take these data through the pipeline implemented in the shallow neural network case study provided under Professor Yuxiao (James) Huangâ€™s GitHub repository and use it to obtain a baseline score. After fine-tuning our model, our results show that we were able to predict the likelihood of fraudulent activity with a 91.0% accuracy rate.
